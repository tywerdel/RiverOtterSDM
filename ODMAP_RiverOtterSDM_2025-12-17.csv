"Overview","Hypotheses","Hypotheses","River otter habitat suitability increases with proximity to surface water and with higher densities of water features. Anthropogenic water features reduce landscape resistance and increase inter-watershed connectivity beyond what is expected from natural hydrology alone."
"Overview","Assumptions","Model assumptions","Species are assumed to be at quasi-equilibrium with contemporary hydrological conditions. Detection errors and misidentification in GBIF records are assumed to be low after filtering. Presence-only data are assumed to represent realized distribution constrained by accessibility to water."
"Overview","Algorithms","Modelling techniques","maxent"
"Overview","Algorithms","Model complexity","Model complexity: Default Maxent feature classes and regularization settings were retained to avoid overfitting and to ensure comparability between contemporary and natural-only hydrology scenarios."
"Overview","Algorithms","Model averaging","No ensemble modelling was used."
"Overview","Workflow","Model workflow","Occurrence records were filtered, spatially thinned, and intersected with hydrological predictor rasters. Maxent models were tuned using k-fold cross-validation and applied to generate continuous suitability predictions under contemporary and natural-only hydrology scenarios. Predictions were thresholded using an omission-based criterion. Suitability surfaces were transformed into resistance layers and summarized at the watershed (HUC-8) scale to compare connectivity and accessibility between scenarios."
